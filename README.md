opencut
=======

opencut is a declarative CAM program for generating gcode for CNC
milling/routing machines.

The easiest way to get started is to create a [YAML](http://yaml.org/)
description of your "job" in the [built-in editor](http://sir-buckyball.github.io/opencut/src/index.html), then press the compile
button to download the gcode.

Advanced users may choose to pass a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) object directly
to the Javascript library. It is also possible to load in additional cut types.

Documentation can be found at http://sir-buckyball.github.io/opencut/src/docs.html.
