      <p>opencut is a declarative CAM program which allows you to generate gcode
        programs for CNC routing machines by stating what cuts you would like
        to have made.</p>

      <p><a href="http://yaml.org">YAML</a> is the description language used to
        describe the cuts to make. It is designed to be easily read by humans, yet
        structured enough to be parsed by any computer language. Under the hood
        the YAML description of the cuts to make is connverted to a JSON job
        object and passed to the opencut API which in turn generates the gcode
        which corresponds to the job.</p>
